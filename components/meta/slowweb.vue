      This platform is a part of the <strong>slow-web movement</strong>. Slow
      movements (e.g., slow-food, slow-textiles) are best understood by what
      they are not. They are not fast. They are not instant gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web is a fast place filled with endless things to do, notifications
      to catch, headlines to scroll through, or videos to watch. Collectively
      this environment brings with it a sense of anxiety, a fear of missing
      out, and a never-ending thirst for more.

      That experience changes when we slow down. Enjoying a home cooked meal vs
      the fast-food burger. A hand knit sweater vs a t-shirt off the rack. Slow
      movements are intentional acts that bring us to a quieter, more intimate
      experience with our world.
