    <h2>Ethics</h2>
    <p>
      Slow reading encourages deeper thinking and consideration of the topics
      at hand. Likewise we must express deeper care for what content we share
      with the world and consider the damage it could do. Therefore, we make
      the following ethical considerations when receiving content for
      publication.
    </p>
    <p><strong>We do not accept:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>content that expresses hateful speech, incites violence, disparages others based on natural qualities of their personhood, or any form of discrimination.</li>
      <li>personal attacks on individuals.</li>
      <li>posts identifying or sharing the personal information of another person (including children)</li>
      <li>comments that are commercial or repeatedly-shared external links</li>
      <li>comments that are defamatory, breach copyright or put us in legal jeopardy</li>
      <li>deliberate attempts to misinform, distort facts, provoke or misrepresent the opinions of others</li>
      <li>the thread of replies if the original comment is deleted</li>
      <li>other comments at editorial discretion</li>
    </ul>
