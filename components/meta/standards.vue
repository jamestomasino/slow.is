    <h2>Standards</h2>
    <p>
      The written works accepted here must adhere to basic editorial standards
      to be fit for publication on the platform.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Works should be written primarily in English. This allows us to fully
        understand what's being published and to judge its quality against the
        other standards and ethical considerations. Short passages or phrases
        in other languages are acceptable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid using profanity. In an effort to keep our audience broad and our
        engagement constructive we limit the use of profanity in published
        content. Individual instances may be censored to allow a piece to be
        published. Excessive use will disqualify the work from inclusion on the
        site.
      </li>
      <li>
        Written works should be well structured and generally free of spelling
        and grammatical mistakes. Given the manual format of the works, some
        liberties are granted for occasional errors. Spelling may be corrected
        in digitized versions.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do not publish sexually explicit or pornographic images or videos.
        Writing about adult topics is permitted as long as it is not
        accompanied by sexually explicit images or videos, or any material that
        promotes or depicts unlawful or inappropriate sexual acts with children
        or animals. Please note that we <em>do</em> distinguish between
        pornography and nudity.
